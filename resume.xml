                  Software application developer on a large scale translational research focused team, the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR).  This team is supported by the NIH, grants, and CTSA awards and provides data to research scientists in a multi-faceted approach.  Some of the tools produced by our team include the "BioVU" databank containing de-identified DNA information, healthcare data warehouses driven by clinical systems such as EPIC and Star, and user facing applications to help support principal investigators in the creation of grant funded research.

                        Developed, maintained, and fine-tuned a large scale IBM Netezza database system that holds 60+ Tb of medical data in both identified and de-identified forms.  Work on this system involes attention to detail as the pipeline systems are designed to gather data from disparate source healthcare databases, files, and extracts and then normalize it into forms usable by the researchers and employees who generate phenotype/genotype cohorts.

                        Key developer in project mangement lead requests for eccentric and specific data "ETL" (Extract Transform Load) requests.  This often involves discussing and fully understanding source data systems, how they are accessed, translated, and will work with our target database schema (OMOP).   Always eager to learn new and intersting methods for improving both technical systems, but also the potential for process/workflow improvement at the employee level.  No stranger to visting departments and labs to better understand how the "machine" works.

                        Instrumental in the decision and implementation to source warehouse data from the newly installed EPIC Healthcare system (Clarity).  This required working with teams across the organization to understand how EPIC would be configured and how we, as a team, would have to react to these changes in order to maintain our steam stream of healthcare data to support research needs.  This included writing an application (Java) to extract needed tables from EPIC's Clarity database, shape the data, and load into our target Netezza system.  This process included attention to the speed at which we could extract data, with the final result being a multi-threaded Spring Boot java application, pipeline changes on the Linux servers, and working with a front-end team to design a dashboard to provide day-to-day system statistics.

                    Researched, developed, implemented, and supported large scale (10,000+ employee) ERP and medical interface systems. These projects involved multi-year timelines as well as integration with many different enterprise teams. Attended training for application and system level educational opportunities such as, EPIC Clarity Database, Informatica Administration and PowerCenter developer.

                        Was lead architect on design of our legacy-to-new data migration needs (SmartStream to PeopleSoft). Designed and implemented an ETL driven, autonomous data collection process which allows for the creation of multiple data-marts that serve customer needs from finance to HR. This project required an understanding of customer needs, usage cases and histories, as well as an ability to imagine what the future business needs will be.

                        Included as key resource on the integration and interface portion of the EPIC migration project. This involved the creation of a framework of EPIC-to-Vendor connections through a Master File Transfer process that utilizes our B2B system. From creation of a file framework that allows for transfer of any type of necessary file to the logging, reporting, and notification systems, I was able to work on a team of peers to create a system-wide process and hand it off to the implementation teams. It is a critical portion of the EPIC healthcare system here at Hartford Healthcare.

				BioVU is Vanderbilt's collection, or “bank,” of de-identified DNA samples. DNA is found in all of your cells and is what carries information from parents to children. Specific sections of DNA, called genes, control certain traits (like eye color) or may be involved in certain diseases. Researchers are using these samples to study the links between genes and disease and between genes and how a patient might respond to a prescribed medication. 
			</description>
			<contribution>
				Designed and contributed to the implementation of a methodology to include EPIC's healthcare data as a source for the systems used to support the BioVU databank.  This included sourcing data from Clarity in a fashion that would allow for continued ingestion of patient data and demographics after the cutover from Star (legacy) to EPIC.

				Winsted Fire is a ISO Class 4 volunteer firefighting department that operates in the city of Winsted, Connecicut.  It has operated since the year 1862 and continues to provide fire suppression, rescue, emergency, and training services to the town and its surrounding area.
                    
                Served on the Winsted Volunteer Fire Department as both a firefighter and lieutenant officer between the years of 2005 and 2016.  		
                Treasurer of the Aerial Ladder (tower) Company
                Was lead person in charge of the "Junior" firefighter program, a Boy Scouts of America (BSA) provided service that allows children aged 14-17 to join and train as exterior firefighters, giving them valulable community service skills as well as an understanding of safety.  Many of these children have progressed to become full adult members of the department as well as paid full-time city departments in the area.
