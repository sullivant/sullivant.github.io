				How many times have you run into a friend and through conversation realized that you had been in the same place at the same time, but managed to not cross paths? It's happened to us more than once. Imagine being able to receive alerts on your mobile phone when friends are in the area, being able to send or request an exact location to meet, and being able to hook up with an old buddy without the headache of planning. This technology would enable you to stay in touch with more people in the most convenient way possible.

			<description>Potential participants seek information about clinical trials for many reasons, but the process can be challenging. We analyzed 101,249 searches in ResearchMatch Trials Today, a free interface to recruiting trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Searches from March 2015 to November 2016 included a broad range of conditions and healthy volunteer concepts, including 12,649 unique topics. Trials Today data indicate that it is being used to identify trials on a variety of topics.</description>
